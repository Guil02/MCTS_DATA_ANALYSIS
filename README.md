# Monte Carlo tree search data analysis

This project aims to implement models that based on certain concepts of a game in the LUDII framework to determine what
the best variation of MCTS is for that game.

## Current State

The project currently only consists of reading in provided data sets and manipulating them such as to have a useful data
set. The resulting data sets themselves are too large to push to github so they are only accessible by run the code.
This luckily does not take too long. To retrieve the data set you only need to run the [main.py](main.py) file. This
will generate the data set into the [new_csv](new_csv) folder.
